Organization of repository
LILA operates in a sequential way, represented in the following flowchart: flowchart source: underlying work (see section above)
![LILA_flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20780213/151023914-1aa42846-8061-43eb-b36a-06954177153f.png)


For leakage identification, the notebook in the folder 'LI' performs linear regression analysis and change point detection to provide the starting times of the leaks, and also provides the error trajectories,.

The first part of the work performing leakage identification is available at: https://github.com/SWN-group-at-TU-Berlin/LILA

Dataset
The work in this repository is applied to the dataset of the [BattLeDIM] (https://battledim.ucy.ac.cy/). Information on the BattLeDIM can be found at:
